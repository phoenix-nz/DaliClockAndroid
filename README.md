# DaliClockAndroid
Port of jwzs daliclock to android

For more information see http://www.jwz.org/xdaliclock/

To build just run make then copy DaliClock_*.apk to your device.

You will need the Android SDK and the Java 7 SDK installed and ANDROID_HOME 
and JAVA_HOME set as system variables respectively.

To change anything I reccommend Android Studio.
